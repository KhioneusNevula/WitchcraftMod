# WitchcraftMod
A mod for witchcraft. Witchcraft is magic that revolves around
<br>a) Potions, made in a cauldron
<br>b) Cantamines, cast using an altar and various devices (usually a wand, pentacle, chalice, and/or athame)
<br>c) more stuff to come
The guide to the mod will be the Book of Shadows. One Book can be created per player by dropping a book and a wand next to each other, and this book will stay in its own special inventory and will automatically reappear there if it ever vanishes or is destroyed
